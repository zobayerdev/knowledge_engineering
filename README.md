## Knowledge Engineering

Welcome to the Knowledge Engineering project repository! This project focuses on the development of advanced systems for acquiring, organizing, and applying knowledge in various domains. We aim to leverage cutting-edge techniques to build intelligent systems that can reason and make decisions based on a wealth of structured knowledge.

### Features:

- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Tools and methods for extracting knowledge from diverse sources, including text, databases, and expert opinions.
- **Knowledge Representation**: Techniques for modeling knowledge in a way that is suitable for automated reasoning and processing.
- **Inference Engines**: Implementations of reasoning algorithms to draw conclusions from the available knowledge base.
- **Ontology Development**: Building structured ontologies to capture relationships and concepts in specific domains.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Integrating NLP techniques for better understanding and interpretation of textual knowledge.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Combining knowledge engineering with machine learning for enhanced decision-making capabilities.
